Level Indicator
1) First we add all the fractals to a S/R list
2) New S and R are calculated based on old S/R being broken
3) Merge levels is still not clear yet
4) All R and S is total of R/S plus new R/still
5) Then we check if the price is in the range of S/R range
6) Then we check for new S/R being broken.



If we have to run it everyday, then the best approach would be to keep a running copy of S/R and new S/range
Eventually I want to be running this as a batch process and when a new data comes, it should only check the new data instead of running through all of them. 

Problems
1) I see both data_1 and data_0, this is a big proble. I dont know what I had in my mind when I designed it, maybe I had this idea of mixing timeframes, like weekly and daily
and seeing if the daily actually crossed the weekly
2) All the indicator values are calculated first only then it runs through the price in strategy, maybe a design for backtest mode.
3) New S/R are not merging with S/R.-
    Solution: The new S/R should merge with S/R then they would be removed from new S/R and added
    to S/R. This way we have expanded the current S/R from the new S/R and then we are removing its scope 

Design solutions:
Eventhough I have this particular logic of adding 2 datapoints into the indicator, I decided for the simplicity I will just stick with 1 data for the time being.
